Title: Build a Full-Stack Student Coding Performance Analytics Platform

➡️ PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Create a full-stack web application called:

“Coding Performance Analytics Dashboard”

This platform is for 54 students and selected faculty members, to:

View their coding progress across LeetCode, CodeChef, CodeForces, etc

Track contest ratings

Track problem-solving stats

View badges

Maintain student portfolios

Edit their coding profile IDs

Allow only authenticated users to view or edit data

Provide analytics dashboards and leaderboards

Build everything in React + Tailwind (frontend) and Node.js + Express + MongoDB + JWT (backend).

⭐ PHASE 1 — Authentication + Home UI + Student Listing
Requirements

Implement JWT authentication with MongoDB.

Only faculty (3 predefined accounts) and students (54) can log in.

Faculty can view only.

Students can view and edit only their own profile.

Homepage shows:

1️⃣ Basic Info Section

Name

Department

Register Number

Email

LinkedIn link

GitHub link

Resume drive link

2️⃣ Coding Accounts Section

Show main account IDs

Show sub accounts (4–5 allowed)

Each account includes:

Platform (LeetCode / CodeChef / CodeForces / GFG / HackerRank / CodeStudio)

Username

Direct link

3️⃣ Coding Analytics Section

(Use dummy data first; real API/scraping later)

A. Problem Solving Analytics

Total problems solved

Per-platform stats

Graph: Problems solved over time

Pie chart: Difficulty distribution

B. Contest Analytics

Merged rating graph for main + sub accounts

Contest history timeline

Highest rating

Current rating

Total contests attended

C. Badges Section

Grid of badges for all platforms.

UI Requirements

Clean dashboard UI

Cards + graphs + grids

Responsive layout

Tailwind utility classes

⭐ PHASE 3 — Student Self-Editing Portal
Workflows

Admin assigns each student a username + password.

Students log in and can edit only their own profile.

Students can update:

Email

Department

LinkedIn

GitHub

Resume Link

Main coding IDs

Sub coding IDs

Faculty accounts cannot edit anything.

Security

Validate fields before saving

Students cannot modify other accounts

⭐⭐ BACKEND REQUIREMENTS ⭐⭐
MongoDB Collections
1️⃣ User Collection
{
  username: String,
  password: String,
  role: "faculty" | "student",
}

2️⃣ Student Collection
{
  name: String,
  username: String,
  dept: String,
  regNo: String,
  email: String,
  linkedin: String,
  github: String,
  resume_link: String,
  main_accounts: [
    { platform: String, username: String }
  ],
  sub_accounts: [
    { platform: String, username: String }
  ]
}

Authentication API

POST /api/auth/login → returns JWT token

GET /api/auth/me → returns user details

Protected Routes

GET /api/students → faculty view all

GET /api/student/:username → returns one student's data

PATCH /api/student/:username → only student can edit their own data

Use middleware:

authMiddleware(["faculty"])
authMiddleware(["student"])

⭐⭐ FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS ⭐⭐
Pages to Build

/login – Login page

/dashboard – Displays

Top coder of the week

List of 54 students

/student/:username – Student Complete Analytics Dashboard

/edit-profile – Only for students

Components Needed

StudentCard

ProfileHeader

AccountCard

ProblemStatsCard

ContestStatsCard

BadgeGrid

EditProfileForm

NavigationBar

⭐⭐ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI TOOL ⭐⭐
When generating code:

Use React functional components

Use TailwindCSS for all styling

Use React Router v6

Use Axios for API calls

Structure folders like:

/frontend
  /src
    /components
    /pages
    /data
    /utils
/backend
  /models
  /routes
  /controllers
  /middleware
  /config

Add dummy data first for analytics → Integrate scraping later.
⭐⭐ ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT ⭐⭐

Please automatically generate:

✔ Student data seeding script
✔ Faculty user seeding script
✔ Full CRUD APIs for student profile
✔ JWT authentication middleware
✔ Protected routes in backend
✔ Graph placeholders in frontend
✔ Clean UI with dashboard layout
🎯 FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Generate a fully structured project (frontend + backend) with:

Authentication

Student listing

Student analytics dashboard

Edit profile system

MongoDB models

API routes

Clean UI

Ready for scraping integration later
